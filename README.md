# Magnify-WotLK

Magnify is a World of Warcraft WotLK (3.3.5a) add-on which allows the user to zoom the world map in or out. The functionality was copied from [Magnify](https://github.com/luskanek/Magnify), and updated/reworked to support the WotLK map.

**Features**

- Scroll to zoom on world map
- Ctrl + Scroll to scale the windowed world map
